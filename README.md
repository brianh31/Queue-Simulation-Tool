# Queue Simulation Tool

## Overview
The **Queue Simulation Tool** is a Java-based application that simulates a service queue with multiple customers. It allows users to add customers with varying service times, process them in a queue, and display key statistics such as total customers served and average service time.

## Features
- **Add Customers**: Create customers with different service times to simulate real-world queue dynamics.
- **Queue Processing**: Serve customers sequentially based on their arrival.
- **Statistics Display**: Calculate and display total customers served, total service time, and average service time.
